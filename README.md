To use the tests, create a directory under the project folder and name it to "data".
Put necessary data such as "DosR" or "E_coli" under this folder.
For other test data, for example testing some particular function in lessons (where you download all the test data),
create another folder and name it to "test_data". Save all files under this folder. File extensions must be txt.
Or simply change the code in any test to give any file path to retrieve_test_data function.

* For graphs "matplotlib" is required.
* In some of the code under week3, I have also used "numpy" for speed testing so it would be necessary for those.
